### A twitter scrapper focused on Data Analysis

So, the idea is pretty simple: a python scrapper for twitter. 
The user must specify two parameters:
1. Enter a hashtag, topic or whatever keyword you would insert in the twitter searchbox
2. The amount of Tweets you want to obtain
   -  *This is important since you don't specifiy the amount of tweets the script will scrap indefinitely*
   
   
Then, you can either export as a csv for your own purpose or you can create a DataFrame object to do your analysis with pandas.
The DataFrame will have the following columns:
+ Date
+ User
+ Hashtags
+ Retweets
+ Likes 
+ Tweet (The content itself of the tweet)
+ URL
